Socket round-trips: 42.773042ms for 10000 ops (avg 4.277µs)
File writes+reads: 1.204009833s for 10000 ops (avg 120.4µs)

NOTE:
- Socket is better in terms of performance.
- Since the value will only be relevant when parent exists, persistent file is not needed
- file operations will also involve disk / fs layer.
